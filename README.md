## orchestra

Orchestra is a keyboard-based instrument that I built to help me teach basic electronics using [MaKey MaKey](http://makeymakey.com). I love using sound and music to teach electronics, but as I've learned the hard way over the years, in a group setting it can be difficult for participants with varying musical experience to collaborate and generate compositions. Orchestra helps alleviate that tension by allowing for multiple synced "instruments" that all produce sound that is complementary.

### Getting Started
Orchestra is a pretty rough tool at this point and thus you'll need to run it yourself within [Quartz Composer](). Once you have downloaded Orchestra and installed XCode / QC, simply open `orchestra.qtz` and follow the in-composition notes to configure.
